## Design Heuristics
Consistency and Standards:<br />
All 3 endpoint interfaces have the same design with different data<br />
Visibility of System Status:<br />
Uses the Play button and Now Playing to indicate whether the video is playing<br />

## IOS Human GuideLines
Simplicity: <br />
The Interface meets this Accessibility guideline because the app's architecture is very basic, consisting of buttons that take you to a specific feature and a back arrow that takes you to the hub.

Prefer simplified gestures for common interactions: <br />
The only gesture needed to use my app is tapping, which is the simplest gesture

Resist the temptation to display your logo throughout your app or game unless itâ€™s essential for providing  context: <br />
The logo is only displayed on the Hub page of the App.

Use color sparingly in non-game apps: <br />
Only highlighting in a color other than black and white is on the back arrow to meet the consistency guideline.
